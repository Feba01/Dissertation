• Analyse multi-source oceanographic data, identifying key environmental stress interactions linked to coral bleaching.
•	Processed and analysed 1.4M+ oceanographic records using Python for data cleaning, imputation, and exploratory analysis, identifying bleaching hotspots and temporal stress patterns.
•	Conducted predictive modelling and statistical analysis to model environmental stress factors, deriving interpretable insights to support early warning and mitigation strategies. 
•	Developed and deployed an interactive Streamlit dashboard to visualise trends, forecasts, and confidence levels, supporting data-driven decision-making for reef conservation.
